## Overview

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is Google's all-encompassing app development platform, providing game developers with an array of backend tools powered by Google Cloud.

Within Unity, we've integrated the Firebase SDK to facilitate backend functionalities. Coupled with the [Google Play Games plugin for Unity](https://github.com/playgameservices/play-games-plugin-for-unity), it ensures a secure and efficient login for Android users.

The integration is further enhanced with a custom [Firebase extension](https://extensions.dev/extensions/openfort/firestore-openfort-transactions), which incorporates the [Openfort SDK](https://github.com/openfort-xyz/openfort-node). This enables Unity clients to directly leverage Openfort's blockchain capabilities, allowing for sophisticated blockchain interactions within the gaming environment.
